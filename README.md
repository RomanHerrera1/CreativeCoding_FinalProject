# Final Class Projects

These were the two projects that I pursued as final projects for my class. I was not able to finish the work on the map project, but the data project is completed (but can be expanded upon).

## Map Project
For my first project, I attempted to create a webpage that would display a map and allow users to input their home address to add a pin to the map at that location. There would also be three different statitics shown on the webpage: the average miles to the current location people would have to travel, the total miles that people theorhetically have travelled, and the average family income across all locations pinned on the map. It was intended to have a message about the globalizaiton of art, using the markers to see how far people have come from. However, it was also intended to be a possible critique of the art sphere, as I feel like galleries are "reserved" for wealthier people. Unfortunately, I encountered some technical difficulties and was not able to complete the project.

## Data Project
For my second project, I decided to create a webpage that would essentially host a silent auction of images. The catch is that in order to access the auction, users had to input their name and a photo was taken of them without their permission and their likeness would be added to the auction. On this auction page, users are able to bid on other people's likeness. This was intended to be a more exaggerated / visual version of what happens in real life and bring attention to the uncomforatability of this experience. I forsee many future expansions for this project, including accessing / displaying / selling even more data, using real money, and actually providing some product of the likeness to the winners of auctions.
